Instructions from your teacher:
No instructions for this assignment

MY NOTES:
  Teacher obviously didn't put any instructions, adn this was from 2018 which
  was half a year ago from this written comment.  Though i am assuming
  this study guide/note shows us how to
  do certain things such as creating, inserting, etc in a sqlite3 database for python
'''
import sqlite3
conn = sqlite3.connect('invoice.db')
c = conn.cursor()

def Create_PassWord_Table():
  c.execute('CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS Password (ID INT, Password char(10))')

def Password_data():
  c.execute("INSERT INTO Password(ID,Password) VALUES(4,'HELLO4'),(5,'Hello2'),(6,'Hello2')")
  conn.commit()

def Read_Data():
  c.execute("SELECT * FROM Password")
  for row in c.fetchall():
    print(row)

Create_PassWord_Table()
Password_data()
Read_Data()

c.close()
conn.close()
