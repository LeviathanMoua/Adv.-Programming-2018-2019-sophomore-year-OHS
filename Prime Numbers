Instructions from your teacher:

Write a Python function that takes a number as a parameter and check the number is prime or not.  Find all the prime numbers from 1 to 100.

Note : A prime number (or a prime) is a natural number greater than 1 and that has no positive divisors other than 1 and itself.

#Code:


numbers = 2
while numbers < 101:
  if numbers == 2 or numbers == 3 or numbers == 5 or numbers == 7:
    print(numbers)
    numbers+=1
  elif numbers%2==0 or numbers%3==0 or numbers%5==0 or numbers%7==0:
    numbers+=1
  else:
    print(numbers)
    numbers+=1


'''
is_it_prime = int(input("Enter a number to check if it's prime.\n\nTrue = Prime False = Composite.\n\nEnter here:"))

numbers = 2
while numbers < 101:
  if numbers == 2 or numbers == 3 or numbers == 5 or numbers == 7:
    print(numbers)
    numbers+=1
  elif numbers%2==0 or numbers%3==0 or numbers%5==0 or numbers%7==0:
    numbers+=1
  else:
    print(numbers)
    numbers+=1

'''
a = int(input("Please insert a number"))

if a % 2 or 3 or 4 or 5 or 6 or 7 or 8 or 9 == 0:
  print("This is a composite number")
else:
  print("This is a prime number")

If I enter the number two, the program is going to say that 
it's composite because two can be divisble by two
